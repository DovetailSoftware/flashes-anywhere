# flashes anywhere

Flashes are a very useful feature in Clarify. They allow you to put important reminders on a
variety of objects. These reminders can be displayed at key points in the Clarify workflow.

Clarify provides flashes for only a small number of objects, however. Since version 5.0 of Clarify
there have been flashes on contacts, sites, and contracts. Later, Clarify expanded this to include
flashes on leads, accounts (bus_orgs), and opportunities.

Customers have many times said that they would like to include flashes on a variety of other
objects such as parts, site_parts, cases, and bugs.

In addition, Clarify customers have been frustrated with the fact that each flash can be related to
one and only one object. For example, suppose that you wish to use the same flash text on four
different sites, and one account. Base Clarify would require you to create five different flashes,
even though they basically are the same. And, in the future, if you wish to modify the text, or
delete the flash, you must modify all five of them.
Finally.

Flashes Anywhere (FA) is a Clarify add-on program that allows an
administrator to easily and quickly set up what types of objects have flashes associated with
them, the sort fields and output fields for each. FA allows the user to associate a single flash with
as many objects as desired. The example given above is a snap with FA.
With Flashes Anywhere, you may create flashes on any table or view in the Clarify system â€“
including user-defined ones.

Flashes Anywhere also allows the user to select flashes, and easily maintain your flashes.
